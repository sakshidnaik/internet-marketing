# Air France Advertising Campaign Analysis

## Project Summary
This project explores Air France's advertising campaigns to understand how ad spending, user engagement, and booking volumes are connected. The goal is to find ways to optimize ad spending and improve campaign performance.

## Overview
The analysis focuses on how Air France can use its advertising budget more effectively. By looking at the relationship between the amount spent on ads, customer engagement (like clicks), and the number of bookings, this project identifies key strategies to boost results.

## Problem Addressed
The main challenge addressed in this project is determining which advertising strategies have the biggest impact on booking volumes. The goal is to identify cost-effective methods that improve ad performance and maximize the return on investment.

## Key Insights and Findings
- **Ad Spend vs. Bookings**: There is a strong link between how much Air France spends on ads and the number of bookings. As ad spending increases, so do bookings, showing that the advertising budget is being used effectively.
- **Clicks vs. Bookings**: Higher customer engagement, measured by the number of clicks, is also strongly linked to more bookings. This indicates that getting more clicks can lead to better campaign performance.
- **Data Trends**: Using scatter plots, the project visualizes these relationships, making it easier to see how factors like ad spending and clicks contribute to successful outcomes.

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that by increasing ad spend and focusing on improving engagement (such as boosting click-through rates), Air France can significantly raise the number of bookings. This data-driven approach provides valuable insights for improving future campaigns and getting the most out of marketing investments.
